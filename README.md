## 1. üß© Problem / Opportunity

Product managers are tasked with understanding customer sentiment to guide product decisions‚Äîbut the process is fragmented and inefficient. Feedback arrives through multiple channels‚Äîemail, social media, surveys‚Äîand compiling it is slow, manual, and siloed. This fragmentation prevents a unified view of what customers are truly experiencing.

Without integrated insights, product teams risk acting on incomplete or conflicting signals, leading to misaligned features, missed opportunities, and products that fail to resonate. A holistic, real-time understanding of customer sentiment is essential for designing solutions that reflect actual user needs.

**Who experiences this problem?**  
Product managers, CX leads, and cross-functional teams responsible for translating customer feedback into product strategy.

**Why it matters:**  
A 360¬∞ view of sentiment enables faster, more confident decision-making, improves alignment across teams, and ensures that product improvements are grounded in real user experiences.

## 2. üéØ Goals and Success Metrics

**Primary Goal:**  
Help product managers synthesize customer feedback across platforms to surface common themes and generate actionable insights.

**Secondary Goals:**  
- Deliver tailored recommendations based on clustered feedback.  
- Automatically prioritize solutions by volume and severity of root issues.

**Success Metrics:**  
- ‚è±Ô∏è‚ÄØ**Time-to-resolution**: Reduction in time required to compile feedback and generate quarterly reports.  
- üìà‚ÄØ**Channel coverage**: Increase in the number of integrated feedback sources.  
- üí¨‚ÄØ**Customer usage**: Growth in daily active users, satisfaction scores, and retention after feedback-driven releases.
