# Sentiment360SApp

# Sentiment360 Prototype

A demo prototype that demonstrates end-to-end sentiment and feedback analysis for customer experience. Many parts are hacked together and use synthetic or AI‑generated data; this README documents the prototype behavior and the production requirements the software engineering team must implement.

---

### Overview

- **Purpose**: Showcase ingestion, basic processing, AI‑generated insights, and dashboard visuals for customer feedback use cases.  
- **Scope**: Prototype uses simulated or AI‑generated snippets for demonstration and does not represent production quality, completeness, or correctness.

---

### Disclosure

This prototype is for illustration only. Insights, dashboards, and functionality must be implemented by the engineering team. The prototype was AI generated and may contain inconsistencies or errors that should be corrected, for example when a metric shows an improvement percentage but the visual indicator points downward.

---

### Data sources and pipeline

- For prototype purposes the app ingests simulated or AI‑generated snippets from a single source.  
- Production requirement: connect to channel APIs to ingest raw posts and messages, store raw data in a centralized data lake, and process it with a scalable data engine. Include schema validation, enrichment, deduplication, and transformation to produce the analytical datasets the frontend consumes.

---

### AI and analytics

- For prototype purposes AI outputs are synthetic and illustrative.  
- Production requirement: run AI on processed datasets to generate tailored, actionable insights that adapt wording, metric selection, and thresholds to each user’s industry and account context. Ensure insights include clear, actionable recommendations.

---

### Indicators and metrics

- For prototype purposes indicators are mocked for demonstration.  
- Production requirement: compute and persist key indicators from canonical processed data. Document and make configurable metric definitions, normalization ranges, and aggregation windows so teams can validate and audit results.

---

### Configuration and data management

- For prototype purposes configuration is simulated.  
- Production requirement: include a Configuration or Data Management tab to add and authorize data sources, upload CSV or batch files for ingestion/backfill, and define or map custom metrics and derived fields. Configuration changes should trigger re‑ingestion or re‑processing as needed.

---

### Authentication and access control

- For prototype purposes authentication and authorization are not implemented.  
- Production requirement: require user authentication and implement role based access control to enforce view, edit, and admin permissions at both API and UI layers.

---

### Interactive visuals and data model

- For prototype purposes visuals are static or loosely connected.  
- Production requirement: ensure visuals are linked and interactive so selections filter and refresh all panels. Backend datasets must maintain referential relationships and dimensional keys so scoped queries return consistent results.

---

### Core platform services

- For prototype purposes infrastructure, security, and operational controls were out of scope.  
- Production requirement: include core platform components such as scalable, highly available architecture; strong security and compliance controls; resilience and disaster recovery; observability and operations; data governance and privacy controls; infrastructure automation; hardened API and integration patterns; and cost governance and monitoring.

---

### Known issues and sanity checks

- Metrics and visuals may be inconsistent or contradictory.  
- Any AI wording or numbers that do not match the visual context must be corrected during engineering implementation.  
- Ensure all sensitive keys and secrets are never stored in source control.

---

### Development notes

- Keep analytics, model training, and inference pipelines separate from the api/frontend deployment to allow independent scaling and testing.  
- Persist intermediate and canonical datasets in the data lake for reproducibility and auditability.  
- Treat the current mock configuration UI as a placeholder; production configuration must include authentication, validation, and change triggers.

### How to move this project from Replit to GitHub

- Create a new empty GitHub repository.  
- Option A use Replit Git integration to connect the project to the new GitHub repo and push commits.  
- Option B open Replit shell and run git init, git add ., git commit -m "Initial commit", git branch -M main, git remote add origin <repo-url>, git push -u origin main.  
- Do not commit secrets or environment variables; move them to a secure secrets store in CI/CD.

---

### Contact and next steps

- Replace synthetic data with real channel integrations and production data pipelines.  
- Implement authentication, RBAC, and operational controls before any external deployment.  
- Validate AI outputs against business rules and human review before surfacing insights to users.
